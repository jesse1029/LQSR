====================================================================

Note that our parameters may different from paper described. However,
our performance of this released code is similar to that of paper.

The main file is "Demo_Proposed.m".
In commend line in Matlab, you can type Demo_Proposed to get the final super-resolved results.
Note that this code only can run in Matlab 32bit version.

If there is any problem, please contact with me.
